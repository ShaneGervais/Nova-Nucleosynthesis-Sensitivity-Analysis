# Nova-Nucleosynthesis-Sensitivity-Analysis
Nuclear post processing analysis from NuGrid's PPN for classical nova. The analysis aims to investigate reaction rate uncertainties for a better understanding on nuclear reaction rates and help to identify further work that is needed experimentally for a set of reactions.
